Page Object Model(POM):

In the 'page layer' of POM, 
1. We maintain the private By locators. 
     We are making these private so that no other classes can use these By locators and also no one else can change their values.
2. We have to create a page constructor
3. We need to write Public Page Methods/Actions.
